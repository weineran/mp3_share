2.1 was carried out by sniffing packets in monitor mode on the 'cs461' network. One of our members has a Macbook and used the Airport utility to 'go silient' and sniff. This was done by the command:
    
     $ airport en1 sniff 1  

en1     - WiFi card
sniff   - argument to sniff packets
1       - channel we sniff in which 'cs461' 

This command writes to a cap file in the tmp directory. We then use aircrack to target 'cs461' and crack it. The command we run to crack the WEP key from our pcap file is:
    
    $ aircrack-ng -1 -a 1 -b 00:0c:e6:9a:a2:c7 airportSniffXXXX.cap

Where '00:0c:e6:9a:a2:c7' is the ID of the 'cs461' network. We need sufficient traffic to crack the key. After ~100,000 IV (initialization vectors) we succesfully cracked the key.
